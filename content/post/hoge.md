* Our magnetosphere is part of a dynamic, interconnected system that responds to solar, planetary, and interstellar conditions – and it all starts deep inside Earth. 
* As electrically charged, molten iron churns far below Earth’s surface, within the planet’s outer core, it generates a magnetic field large enough to extend far out into space. 
* On the Sun-facing side of Earth – where the magnetic field is compressed by the constant bombardment of the solar wind – the magnetosphere extends some 6 to 10 times the radius of Earth.
* The side of the magnetosphere facing away from the Sun – the nightside – stretches out into an immense magnetotail, which fluctuates in length and can measure hundreds of Earth radii, extending far past the Moon's orbit at 60 Earth radii.
