![Magnetosphere](images/magnetosphere.gif#imgMag)
Earth’s internal magnetism creates a region around the planet known as the magnetosphere. While several planets in our solar system have magnetospheres, Earth has the strongest one of all the rocky planets: Our magnetosphere is a vast, comet-shaped bubble, and it has played a crucial role in our planet's habitability. 

Life on Earth initially developed, and continues to be sustained, under the protection of this magnetic environment. The magnetosphere shields our home planet from harmful solar and cosmic particle radiation, as well as erosion of the atmosphere by the solar wind – the constant flow of charged particles streaming off the Sun. Additionally, space weather within the magnetosphere – where many of our spacecraft reside – can sometimes have adverse effects on space technology as well as communications systems like radio and GPS. So, a better understanding of the magnetosphere also helps improve our space weather models and protect our assets in space.


#### Research on Magnetosphere

>NASA heliophysics missions contributing to magnetospheric research are: Geotail; the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS); Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms and Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun (THEMIS-ARTEMIS). Additionally, instruments on other NASA missions – for example, Juno, which observes Jupiter – observe the magnetospheres of other planets.
